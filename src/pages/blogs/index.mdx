Hey, I'm a sophemore at the National University of Singapore. I have experience working with website development and data analysis using machine learning and deep learning techniques as well.

Here, you can find some technical blogs that I have written to hopefully guide beginners who are getting into programming. Perhaps in the future this might even be a repository of information and insights! Or maybe just a collection of stories and adventures through my life.
