title: The Clueless Developer
---

## Welcome to my Blog

Aside from all the hustling, I love documenting all my adventures and life lessons to share them with people around. I hope to inspire and eventually start a tech-for-good organisation where we can help those marginalised rise through techlogical advancements and initiatives.

I like to call myself the clueless developer as I believe that many of us in the computing track are always lost and confused. I hope to inspire and reassure all the young developers that it's normal and okay to be lost at times, but we will all eventually get there!

On the less serious side of things, I am considering documenting my food adventures here as well.
