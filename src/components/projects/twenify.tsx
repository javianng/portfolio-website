      <h2 className="h2">Project Overview</h2>
      <p className="p">
        In the fast-paced and often overwhelming world of academics, students
        frequently struggle with time management and maintaining productivity
        due to distractions like social media. Twenify addresses these issues
        head-on by offering a suite of tools that boost focus, organization, and
        motivation.

      <p className="p">
        Research indicates over half of college students experience significant

        distractions like &quot;doom scrolling&quot; on social media platforms.
        The need for a solution that not only helps manage time but also
        enhances focus and motivation was clear.
