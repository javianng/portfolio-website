      <h2 className="h2">Introduction</h2>
      <p className="p">
        As Singapore continues to experience high demand in the housing market,
        accurately predicting future prices of Housing Development Board (HDB)
        resale flats becomes crucial for effective financial planning. Our
        project focused on developing a robust time series forecasting model to
        predict HDB housing prices, integrating historical transaction data with
        geographical features.
      </p>
      <h2 className="h2">Objectives</h2>
      <ol className="ol">
        <li>
          To create accurate forecasting models for HDB resale prices that
          assist potential buyers and investors in making informed decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          To leverage multi-source data, including transaction records,
          geographical points of interest, and economic indicators like the
          Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p className="p">
        Developed a diverse modeling approach that combined both traditional
        ensemble methods and advanced deep learning techniques to handle the
        complex nature of the datasets. Successfully integrated
        multi-dimensional data from various sources, enhancing the model&apos;s
        input features and predictive accuracy. Our models achieved high
        accuracy in forecasting, demonstrated by strong performance metrics like
        R2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, particularly on the unseen data for 2024.
