                            <br />
                            <p>I am a Business Analytics Sophemore and a passionate developer and analyst based in Singapore.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                <span className="font-mono text-red-400">Hello World!</span> was when I found my passion for coding.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                When I was a child, I was always tearing apart computers and putting them together, diving deep into window&apos;s shell only to break the computer... It was only after I came across CS50X on edX when my interest in programming peaked and now, I am a Business Analytics Sophemore.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                I love new experiences that pushes my boundaries outside of my comfort zone. I love reading productivity and self-help books, and gathering new skillsets from MOOCs. I love travelling, taking photos and playing the guitar. Most of all, I love meeting people from all walks of life, to understand our different experiences and life lessons.
                            </p>
                            <br />

                                I am always down for a chat online or over a cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out to me using the links below! Interested in working together? We should queue up a time to chat. I&apos;ll buy the coffee.
