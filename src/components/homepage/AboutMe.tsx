            <p>
              I am a Business Analytics Sophemore and a passionate developer and
              analyst based in Singapore.

              <span className="font-mono text-red-400">Hello World!</span> was
              when I found my passion for coding.

              When I was a child, I was always tearing apart computers and
              putting them together, diving deep into window&apos;s shell only
              to break the computer... It was only after I came across CS50X on
              edX when my interest in programming peaked and now, I am a
              Business Analytics Sophemore.

              I love new experiences that pushes my boundaries outside of my
              comfort zone. I love reading productivity and self-help books, and
              gathering new skillsets from MOOCs. I love travelling, taking
              photos and playing the guitar. Most of all, I love meeting people
              from all walks of life, to understand our different experiences
              and life lessons.
            </p>

              I am always down for a chat online or over a cup of coffee. Feel
              free to reach out to me using the links below! Interested in
              working together? We should queue up a time to chat. I&apos;ll buy
              the coffee.
