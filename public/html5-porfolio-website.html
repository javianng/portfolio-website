   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>Hello World! was when I found my passion for coding.</p>
   <p>As a child, I was passionate about tearing apart computers and putting them together, diving deep into window's shell only to break the computer... It was only after I came across CS50X on edX when my interest in programming peaked and now, I am a Year 1 Business Analytics Undergraduate.</p>
   <p>As a person, I have always defined myself as a full-time student. I love picking up new sports and hobbies - as evident from my variety of CCAs in school. I love reading and learning productivity and self help books, and gathering new skillsets from MOOCs. To accelerate my education and passion for business analytics, I am currently teaching myself BigQuery, SQL and Visual Basic for Applications using online resources in hopes of utilizing these skills in my future career.</p>
   <p>I look forward to connecting with you here on LinkedIn, or you can email me at <a href="mailto:javian.ng.z.h@gmail.com">javian.ng.z.h@gmail.com</a>.</p>

   <h2>Volunteering</h2>
      <p><u>Community Educator</u><br>
         Jul 2018 - Nov 2018<br>
         <p>I took part in the 6-day Overseas Community Involvement Project (OCIP) in Chiangmai, Thailand, with several months of planning and preparation. I was appointed as the team leader in charge of Day 1 of the trip and led a team of 4 members. OCIP had 3 stages, planning, preparation and execution. The planning and preparation took over 5 months and we had to juggle academics and co-curricular activities alongside.</p>
         <p>During the planning phase, the team had to brainstorm and plan fun activities to bond and gain the trust of the students there, and educational health lessons to be taught. As we would be planning for Day 1, gaining the trust and excitement of the students in Chiang-Mai is crucial to the success of the following day's activities. My team have distributed the workload well and efficiently, giving us a well-planned schedule and logistics.</p>
         <p>During the preparation phase, my team was able to come up with the props and materials needed for the education and games. We even taught the entire OCIP team a dance, which was performed multiple times in Chiangmai to different groups of students there. This was despite the team not having any prior dance experience. All these were achieved with good time management, planned out and deliberate group meetings, a well-distributed workload, and a good team direction.</p>
         <p>During the execution phase in Chiangmai, my team managed to achieve the goals of teaching the students basic English and oral hygiene while building trust and forging bonds with the students. This was achieved despite changes to the predicted assigned logistics in Chiang Mai and the location layout. We have managed to overcome the challenges with teamwork, leadership skills, creativity in utilising the resources we have and strong adaptability. </p>
         <p>All in all, I have forged lasting friendships and connections with my fellow OCIP mates, while honing my soft skills.</p>

      <p><u>Student Volunteer</u><br>
         Jun 2018<br>
         <p>I visited St John's Home for Elderly. During my time there, I interacted with the elderly, entertaining and communicating with them to learn more about their lives. I assisted them when they required help. The objective of this visit was to lighten the mood and bring joy to the elderly there.</p>
         <p>Over there, I have connected and befriended other fellow volunteers who are like-minded and care for the elderly. We worked together to lighten the load of the caretakers there, allowing them to rest and take a breather from caring for multiple elderly's needs all at once. My jovial and happy-go-lucky nature allowed the elderly to open up to me. Through this experience, I have definitely sharpened my soft skills, such as communicating with people of all ages and cultures, working with peers of different personalities and strengths and adaptability to the new environment and tasks that I was volunteering and helping out in.</p>
